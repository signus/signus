    I am maintaining my source repositories outside of GitHub.
    I will maintain my profile for the use of contributions and following projects I like.
    I do not condone many actions of GitHub on their platform.
    The rights of users and developers alike are being eroded.
contact:
  - TBD
repositories:
  - codeberg.org/signus
  - gitlab.com/signusio
```
<!--
**Signus/signus** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
